# Photoresistor
An easy project for Atmega.
The aim for this project is to create an easy program in c++, which can measure light level with photoresistor, LCD screen and microchip Atmega 328.
Sketch consist some basic declaration of pinouts and two major functions- Calculate and Show.

These are the changes in branch test 

The first one measure voltage across the photoresistor and calculate the lux on it. The second one display the outcomes on LCD screen.
Lux value depends on what type of photoresistor you choose.You have to take measures of resistance in places with diffrent light power. 
To open codefile I suggest do it with Arduino IDE app.
