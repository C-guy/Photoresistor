# Photoresistor
An easy project for Atmega 
The aim for this project is to create an easy program in c++, which can measure light level with photoresistor, LCD screen and microchip Atmega 328.
Sketch consist some basic declaration of pinouts and two major functions- Calculate and Show.
The first one measure voltage across the photoresistor and calculate the lux on it. The ceond one display the outcomes no LCD screen.
